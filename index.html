    The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)
    to<br>
    communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic,
    business,<br>
    and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical
    networking<br>
    technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked<br>
    hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United
    States<br>
    Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET,
    initially<br>
    served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the
    National<br>
    Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial
    extensions, led to<br>
    worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The
    linking of<br>
    commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern
    Internet, and<br>
    generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were
    connected to the<br>
    network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services
    and<br>
    technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.
