    <h1>Hypertext transfer protocol</h1>
    <p>
        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for<br>
        distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for<br>
        the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily<br>
        access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.</p>

    <p>Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document<br>
        describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP protocol version that was named 0.9.</p>

    <p>That first version of HTTP protocol soon evolved into a more elaborated version that was the first draft toward a<br>
        far future version 1.0.</p>

    <p>Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) started a few years later and it was a coordinated effort<br>
        by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to<br>
        the IETF.</p>

    <p>HTTP/1 was finalized and fully documented (as version 1.0) in 1996.[4] It evolved (as version 1.1) in 1997 and<br>
        then its specifications were updated in 1999, 2014, and 2022.</p>

    <p>Its secure variant named HTTPS is used by more than 80% of websites.</p>

    <p>HTTP/2, published in 2015, provides a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire". It is now used<br>
        by 43% of websites[7] and supported by almost all web browsers (over 97% of users).[8] It is also supported by<br>
        major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)<br>
        extension[9] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.</p>

    <p>HTTP/3, the successor to HTTP/2, was published in 2022.[12] It is now used by over 25% of websites[13] and is<br>
        supported by many web browsers (over 75% of users).[14] HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying<br>
        transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolesce previous major versions of the protocol. Support for<br>
        HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome first,[15][16] and is also enabled in Firefox.[17] HTTP/3 has<br>
        lower latency for real-world web pages, if enabled on the server, load faster than with HTTP/2, and even faster<br>
        than HTTP/1.1, in some cases over 3x faster than HTTP/1.1 (which is still commonly only enabled).</p>
